### [2026-05-29] Challenge: Restarting Challenges
- **Target:** Start Here -> Restarting Challenges
- **Issue:** After getting the password wrong, the challenge environment self-destructed as intended. However, initiating a VM reset via the platform caused a connection error, preventing the terminal from reconnecting automatically.
- **Fix:** Performed a hard browser refresh to re-initialize the web interface and successfully restored the terminal session.
- **Result:** Reconnected to the fresh VM instance, provided the previously revealed password, and captured the flag.
